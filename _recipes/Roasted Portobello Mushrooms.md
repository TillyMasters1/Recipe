- 1 onion
- 1 tablespoon mustard
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar

- sugar
- 2 tablespoons canola oil

- 3 sprigs parsley
- 6 tablespoons breadcrumbs (preferably whole-grain)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- Clean mushrooms. Slice off stems and remove gills, if desired.
- Heat the remaining olive oil in a pan. Sauté the mushrooms over high heat until browned on all sides. Season with salt and pepper.
- Transfer mushrooms to a baking sheet and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Bake in preheated oven at 200°C (fan 175°C, gas mark 3) (approximately 400°F) until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately with salad.
