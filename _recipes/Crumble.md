title: "Peach Crisp"
image: Crumble.jpg

Ingredients: "Ingredients"

ingredients:
- Honeycrisp Apples
- Cinnamon
- Allspice
- Lemon juice
- Sugar
- Maple syrup
- Oats
- Almond flour
- Walnut butter or pecan butter

directions:
- Make the filling. Slice the apples into 1/4 inch wedges and add to a large bowl. Add the spices, sugar, lemon juice and pecans. I finely chop these since my husband and daughter aren’t big fans of chunks of nuts. Stir for a good couple of minutes until the apples are evenly coated. Set aside.
- Make the topping. To a medium bowl, add the syrup, walnut butter and cinnamon and stir until smooth. Add the oats and almond flour and mix for a couple of minutes until very thick and sticky, as pictured.
- Fill the pie dish. Lightly spray a 9 inch pie dish with nonstick spray and spread out the prepared apples in an even layer. Top with the topping mixture with your fingers and make sure all the apples are well covered evenly.
- Bake the apple crisp. Top the crisp with extra raw sugar for crunch, sweetness and shine. Bake for about 25 minutes in a preheated oven at 375°F, until the apples are tender and the top is a nice golden brown.
