title: "Peach Crisp"
image: Crumble.jpg
Ingredients: "Ingredients (Filling)"
2nd-Ingredients: "Ingredients (Topping)"

ingredients:
- 4 heaping cups (430g) of peeled and sliced honeycrisp apples, into 1/4 inch slices (the weight is AFTER they are peeled/sliced)
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice
- 1 tablespoon raw sugar (please understand that if you change the apples to sour or less sweet than honeycrisp, you may need more sugar)
- pinch salt
- 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans (optional)

2nd-ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (160g) pure maple syrup
- 4 tablespoons (64g) of my homemade walnut butter or pecan butter
- 1 1/2 cups (150g) gluten free old fashioned oats
- 3/4 cup (84g) blanched almond flour (this keeps it moist, do not sub with another flour, as that will change the buttery topping)
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- Optional(2 tablespoons raw sugar for sprinkling on top, highly recommended for shine and crunch!)


directions:
- First, you will need to make the walnut butter or pecan butter. It helps to do this the day before so it's ready to go. This replaces any oil or butter, yet still gives a wonderful buttery taste and crisp.
- Preheat the oven to 375°F and lightly grease the bottom of a 9 inch pie dish.
- For the filling, peel and slice the apples into 1/4 inch wedges and add to a large bowl. Add the cinnamon, allspice, sugar, lemon juice and pecans. Set aside.
- For the topping, to a separate medium bowl, add the syrup, walnut butter and cinnamon and stir until smooth. Add the oats and almond flour and mix for a couple of minutes until very thick and sticky, as pictured.
- Spread out the prepared apples in an even layer into the pie dish. Top with the topping mixture with your fingers and make sure all the apples are well covered evenly.
- Bake for about 25 minutes or until the apples are tender and the top is a nice golden brown.
- Apple crisps are best served immediately while warm. Top with dairy-free whip cream, such as the So Delicious cocowhip or a vegan ice cream
